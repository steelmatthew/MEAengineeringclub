							<h3>Welcome to the third secret page!</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Congrats for completing the “fun way” to learn about the MEA Engineering club! At our club, we learn about engineering related things in a (hopefully) entertaining way!  To be honest, it's really difficult. Especially because there are so many different aged students going to my club. So bear with me if it gets a little slow sometimes… though hopefully that never will happen. Congrats again on finding this! <!--If you are a little older, you might find some of the things on “Nerdy Stuff” interesting, so take a look at it if you have the time! --></p> 
						<!--<p> <i>There is one last secret over there too… let's see if you can find it, this time with no hints!</i> </p>-->

						<br>
						As prize for finding all these secrets, here are some engineering related jokes: 
						<br> 

						<br>
						<b>Joke 1: </b>
						<br> 
						An engineer, a statistician, and a physicist are out hunting. They spot a buck, and each take turns to try and bag it. The physicist goes first. He pulls out his lab book and quickly calculates the trajectory of the bullet, assuming it is a perfect sphere in a vacuum.
						
						The bullet falls 20m short of the deer.	
						<br><br>
						The engineer goes second. He pulls out his engineer's pad and book of projectile assumptions. After a few minutes he’s ready, he takes aim, and fires.
						The bullet lands 20m passed the deer. 
						<br><br>
						The statistician leaps in the air shouting, “We got it!”
						</p>
						<p>
						
						<b>Joke 2: </b>
						<br> 
						A priest, a doctor, and an engineer were waiting one morning for a particularly slow group of golfers. The engineer fumed, "What's with those guys? We must have been waiting for fifteen minutes!" The doctor chimed in, "I don't know, but I've never seen such inept golf!"
						<br><br>
						The priest said, "Here comes the green-keeper. Let's have a word with him." He said, "Hello George, what's wrong with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow, aren't they?"
						<br><br>
						The group fell silent for a moment. The priest said, "That's so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight." The doctor said, "Good idea. I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist colleague and see if there's anything he can do for them."
						<br><br>
						The engineer said, "Why can't they play at night?"
						</p>
						<p>
						<br>
						<b>Joke 3: </b>
						<br><br>
						A farmer challenges an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician to fence off the largest amount of area using the least amount of fence. 
						<br><br>
						The engineer made his fence in a circle and said it was the most efficient. The physicist made a long line and said that the length was infinite. Then he said that fencing half of the earth was the best. 
						<br><br>
						The mathematician laughed at the others and, with his design, beat them in the challenge. What did he do?
						<br><br>
						He decided to build a fence around himself. Then, he claimed he was outside of the fence.
